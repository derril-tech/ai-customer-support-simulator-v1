# AI Customer Support Simulator

A multi-agent training & evaluation platform that simulates customer support interactions (chat, email, and voice) with realistic customers, live policies, and knowledge bases‚Äîthen auto-scores responses, coaches the agent, and exports QA reports/macros to your help desk.

## What's new (2025-10)

- Voice simulator: smoother ASR with pause-based flush, codec fallbacks, and client WAV fallback for Deepgram compatibility
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) via TTSOpenAI with webhook-based delivery and automatic playback of customer replies
- Auto-send toggle and manual Send for voice input; ‚ÄúCustomer is writing‚Ä¶‚Äù typing indicator on Voice
- End Session + View Live Scoring added to Chat, Voice, and Email; Chat page auto-starts the session after scenario selection
- Live scoring via WebSocket with progressive updates and final scoring summary [[memory:10052027]]
- Footer links: GitHub and LinkedIn

## ‚ú® What this application is

The AI Customer Support Simulator is a practical sandbox where support reps and AI agents practice handling realistic customer interactions across chat, email, and voice. It enforces policies and knowledge-base citations in real time, scores every interaction against a rubric, and generates actionable coaching plus exportable macros and reports. Think of it as a flight simulator for customer support.

## üí° Benefits

- **Faster onboarding**: Ramp new reps with realistic scenarios and immediate feedback.
- **Consistent QA**: Objective, rubric-based scoring with transparent rationales.
- **Policy compliance**: Live guardrails and KB-citation enforcement reduce risk.
- **Skill development**: Coach mode nudges best practices while preserving autonomy.
- **Operational insights**: Analytics highlight knowledge gaps and process friction.
- **Reusable outputs**: Export macros, KB delta proposals, and LMS packages.

## üß≠ Where this can be applied

- **Rep onboarding and upskilling** (Tier 1‚Äì3)
- **Vendor/BPO quality management**
- **Continuous training after policy or product changes**
- **Regulated industries** (enforcement + auditable scoring)
- **AI agent evaluation** before production rollout
- **LMS content generation** (SCORM/xAPI packages)

## ü§ñ AI Agents Framework Choice: CrewAI

This simulator uses **CrewAI** to orchestrate multiple specialized agents (customer, triage, knowledge, compliance, coaching, supervisor, scribe, scoring). CrewAI provides a clear mental model (roles ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí tools) and predictable execution that maps well to customer support workflows.

### ‚úÖ Why CrewAI for this project

- **Maps to support orgs**: Roles (triage, compliance, coach, supervisor) mirror real teams.
- **Readable & maintainable**: Clear roles/tasks keep complex behavior understandable.
- **Rapid iteration**: Quick to compose new agents/tools for experiments.
- **Python everywhere**: Works smoothly with FastAPI, Celery, and analytics stack.
- **Enough structure, not too rigid**: Balances control with developer velocity.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ 
- Python 3.11+
- Git

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-customer-support-simulator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start development environment**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:3001
   - API Docs: http://localhost:3001/api
   - Orchestrator: http://localhost:8000
   - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001

### Voice setup (ASR + TTS)

- Open the app and use the API Key modal to enter your keys (OpenAI, Deepgram, TTS)
- Or set the required env vars in `.env` (see Configuration below)
- Microphone permission is required in the browser for Voice

Notes:
- ASR uses Deepgram (best with `audio/webm;codecs=opus` or `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`). The app falls back to `audio/webm` and client-side `WAV PCM 16k mono` if needed.
- TTS uses TTSOpenAI with webhook completion; audio is pushed back to the session and auto-plays on customer replies.
