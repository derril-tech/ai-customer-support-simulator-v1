# AI Customer Support Simulator

A multi-agent training & evaluation platform that simulates customer support interactions (chat, email, and voice) with realistic customers, live policies, and knowledge bases—then auto-scores responses, coaches the agent, and exports QA reports/macros to your help desk.

## ✨ What this application is

The AI Customer Support Simulator is a practical sandbox where support reps and AI agents practice handling realistic customer interactions across chat, email, and voice. It enforces policies and knowledge-base citations in real time, scores every interaction against a rubric, and generates actionable coaching plus exportable macros and reports. Think of it as a flight simulator for customer support.

## 💡 Benefits

- **Faster onboarding**: Ramp new reps with realistic scenarios and immediate feedback.
- **Consistent QA**: Objective, rubric-based scoring with transparent rationales.
- **Policy compliance**: Live guardrails and KB-citation enforcement reduce risk.
- **Skill development**: Coach mode nudges best practices while preserving autonomy.
- **Operational insights**: Analytics highlight knowledge gaps and process friction.
- **Reusable outputs**: Export macros, KB delta proposals, and LMS packages.

## 🧭 Where this can be applied

- **Rep onboarding and upskilling** (Tier 1–3)
- **Vendor/BPO quality management**
- **Continuous training after policy or product changes**
- **Regulated industries** (enforcement + auditable scoring)
- **AI agent evaluation** before production rollout
- **LMS content generation** (SCORM/xAPI packages)

## 🤖 AI Agents Framework Choice: CrewAI

This simulator uses **CrewAI** to orchestrate multiple specialized agents (customer, triage, knowledge, compliance, coaching, supervisor, scribe, scoring). CrewAI provides a clear mental model (roles → tasks → tools) and predictable execution that maps well to customer support workflows.

### ✅ Why CrewAI for this project

- **Maps to support orgs**: Roles (triage, compliance, coach, supervisor) mirror real teams.
- **Readable & maintainable**: Clear roles/tasks keep complex behavior understandable.
- **Rapid iteration**: Quick to compose new agents/tools for experiments.
- **Python everywhere**: Works smoothly with FastAPI, Celery, and analytics stack.
- **Enough structure, not too rigid**: Balances control with developer velocity.
